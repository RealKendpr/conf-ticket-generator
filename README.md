## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React + Typescript](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I started learning to use React Hook Form to manage form submission and validation, and I learned about controlled and uncontrolled forms. Also discovered [Utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) for generating fluid typography, and Dropzone; a react library to drag n drop files.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about react hook form, and the re-rendering of react components. Integrating dropzone with forms, and how to use fluid typography better.

### Useful resources

- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [React Dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/) - Simple React hook to create a HTML5-compliant drag'n'drop zone for files.
- [Utopi.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) - Instead of designing for x number of arbitrary breakpoints, we can design a system within which elements scale proportionally and fluidly.
